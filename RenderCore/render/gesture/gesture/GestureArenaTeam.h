/// A group of [GestureArenaMember] objects that are competing as a unit in the
/// [GestureArenaManager].
///
/// Normally, a recognizer competes directly in the [GestureArenaManager] to
/// recognize a sequence of pointer events as a gesture. With a
/// [GestureArenaTeam], recognizers can compete in the arena in a group with
/// other recognizers. Arena teams may have a captain which wins the arena on
/// behalf of its team.
///
/// When gesture recognizers are in a team together without a captain, then once
/// there are no other competing gestures in the arena, the first gesture to
/// have been added to the team automatically wins, instead of the gestures
/// continuing to compete against each other.
///
/// When gesture recognizers are in a team with a captain, then once one of the
/// team members claims victory or there are no other competing gestures in the
/// arena, the captain wins the arena, and all other team members lose.
///
/// For example, [Slider] uses a team without a captain to support both a
/// [HorizontalDragGestureRecognizer] and a [TapGestureRecognizer], but without
/// the drag recognizer having to wait until the user has dragged outside the
/// slop region of the tap gesture before triggering. Since they compete as a
/// team, as soon as any other recognizers are out of the arena, the drag
/// recognizer wins, even if the user has not actually dragged yet. On the other
/// hand, if the tap can win outright, before the other recognizers are taken
/// out of the arena (e.g. if the slider is in a vertical scrolling list and the
/// user places their finger on the touch surface then lifts it, so that neither
/// the horizontal nor vertical drag recognizers can claim victory) the tap
/// recognizer still actually wins, despite being in the team.
///
/// [AndroidView] uses a team with a captain to decide which gestures are
/// forwarded to the native view. For example if we want to forward taps and
/// vertical scrolls to a native Android view, [TapGestureRecognizers] and
/// [VerticalDragGestureRecognizer] are added to a team with a captain(the captain is set to be a
/// gesture recognizer that never explicitly claims the gesture).
/// The captain allows [AndroidView] to know when any gestures in the team has been
/// recognized (or all other arena members are out), once the captain wins the
/// gesture is forwarded to the Android view.
///
/// To assign a gesture recognizer to a team, set
/// [OneSequenceGestureRecognizer.team] to an instance of [GestureArenaTeam].
